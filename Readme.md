#  m-cli

:boom: **Swiss Army Knife for macOS !**

## The difference

**m-cli** differs from other mac command line tools in that:

* Its main purpose is to manage administrative tasks and do it easier
* It doesn't install 3rd party tools because it doesn't have dependencies
* The installation is very easy and doesn't require intervention
* It only uses macOS commands


## Installation

* **Using Homebrew:**

  `brew install m-cli`

* **Manual installation:**

  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgcr/m-cli/master/install.sh | sh`

  You can also install it in a different path

  `INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.m-cli sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgcr/m-cli/master/install.sh)`

  _Note: You need privileges_
